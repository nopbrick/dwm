# DWM - Dynamic Window Manager

This is my personal build of Suckless' DWM. It consists of several patches and will be updated periodically. 
It also includes the .desktop file for LightDM configuration under /usr/share/xsessions/ and the dwmscript bash script with initial actions executed upon DMW start.
